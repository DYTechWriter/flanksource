# Screenshots

1. Use close up screenshots where possible rather than full page screenshot
  * Use Chrome -> Inspect -> Right Click Capture Node Screenshot
2. Never include the browser frame
3. The screenshot should have good quality / realistic data - If necessary modify the html before taking a screenshot

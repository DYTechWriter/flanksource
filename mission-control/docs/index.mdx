Flanksource Mission Control is an Internal Developer Platform that helps teams improve developer productivity and operational resilience.

![](/img/how-it-works.svg)

With Mission Control you can:

* [Catalog](./config-db) and track changes on infrastructure, applications and configuration.
* [Empower Developers](./playbooks) with self-service playbooks for Day 0-2 operations.
* [Run Health Checks](./canary-checker) across both cloud-native and legacy infrastructure and applications.
* [Incrementally Adopt GitOps](./playbooks/actions/gitops) with playbooks that perform Git commits in the background.
* [Aggregate Alerts](./canary-checker/probes) from Prometheus, Cloudwatch, Datadog, etc.
* [Visualize Complex Systems](./topology/overview) with a multi-dimensional system topology.
* [Build Event Driven Control Planes](./playbooks/actions/gitops) with a combination of webhooks, events and GitOps.
* [Notify People and Systems](./notifications/overview) about changes in health and configuration.


### When not to use Mission Control

Mission Control is best suited for medium to large teams with complex infrastructure and applications. If you have a simple setup with just a few servers, tools like Ansible, Terraform and Prometheus may be enough.

* **Your primary concern is Develop**_**ment**_ **Experience & Maturity**. Mission Control is focused on improving the **operational experience for develop*ers***, enabling them to quickly understand, troubleshoot and operate on complex systems.
* **You prefer ClickOps to GitOps**. Mission Control is built on a GitOps first principle, and configured using Kubernetes Custom Resource Defintions. While there is a configuration UI, it is primarily for rapid prototyping and testing.
* **Your application / team has no dependencies across multiple teams or services**. Mission Control is best suited for distributed systems with dependencies across teams and services that need to be visualized and tracked.

:::tip
While YAML is preferred for configuration, Mission Control does provide highly optimized UI for viewing, navigating and operating on the catalogs and playbooks defined in YAML/CRDs.
:::

* Your system is very simple with few applications, dependencies and changes.

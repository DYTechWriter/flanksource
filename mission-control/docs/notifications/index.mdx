import Notification from "../reference/notifications/_notification.mdx"

Notifications can be sent based on different type of events occuring including:

- Health check failing (`check.failed`)
- Aggregated health of a topology failing (`component.unhealthy`)
- A scraped config item health (`config.unhealthy`)


```yaml title="http-check.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: http-check
  namespace: default
spec:
  events:
    - check.passed
  filter: check.type == 'http'
  to:
    email: alerts@acme.com
```

<Notification/>

## Templating

Notification title and bodies can be templated using <CommonLink to="gotemplate">Go Templates</CommonLink>
```yaml title="template-title.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
spec:
  // highlight-next-line
  title: Check {{.check.name}} is {{.check.health}}
```

## Filtering

Notifications can be filtered using <CommonLink to="cel">CEL</CommonLink> expressions. The filters have access to same [variables](./events) that can be used in the templates.

```yaml title="filter-http.yaml"
